        <h2>Story & Info</h2>
        <p>Release date: 22.01.2026</p>
        <p>The story takes place in a fictional world of Talos-II full of people with animal characteristics. While
            there are certain sci-fi elements such as highly advanced technology or space travel and colonization, the
            world itself is much more fantasy-like.</p>
        <p> We play as the CEO of Endfield industries, Endministrator, who just woke up from a long sleep and now
            suffers amnesia. Together with our allies form Endfield we work on helping those in need using the power of
            Originium Arts created by the Endministrator. At the same time we fight against monsters and enemies who
            are spreading chaos accross the world.</p>

        <h2>Battle Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Arknights: Endfield features real-time action combat where players directly control one
            character. What makes it unique is the fact that other members of the team are on field at the same time and
            also fight under AI control with the ability to switch to them anytime.</p>
        <p>For seamless fight players utilize the characters' attacks such as Battle Skills which in turn cost SP that
            regenerates overtime, dodge mechanics which cost stamina, Combo Skills with other team members or elemental
            states. A successful fight therefore needs not only skill but also putting together a team with good
            synergy.</p>
